**SimpleStatics.R**
Showcases a few of the statistic tools in R.

**SimpleLinearRegression.R** 
Shows a simple example of linear regression implemented. The example is to predict the profit a sales company makes based on the duration the sales team spends on a call.

So we try to fix a linear regression model to output the duration of the call based on the profit made.

**AprioriAssociationRules.R**
A simple implementation of the MarketBasketProblem. A small dataset is imported with just 8 entries, but the algo can be used even for datasets with thousands of transaction records.
The confidence is set to 80%. So predictions are shown only for recommendations which are 80% right.

The training data is located in the data folder named *transactions.csv*.

We are also displaying a frequency plot to show the frequency with which items are bought.

**RJava.R**
Sample R script to showcase the rJava package.
Detailed description of libraries and methods used are described in the script.
